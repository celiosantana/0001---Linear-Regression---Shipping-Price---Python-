# 0001---Linear-Regression---Shipping-Price---Python-

🇬🇧 - English

🏁 - This project was developed in Python to test how the Linear Regression function (SKLearn) works. The idea is to predict when a shipping will arrive, informing how much we pay for that shipping. There is a small historical basis (dataset), and the idea is to have answers based on this historical base.
